Besides being good for the earth, the Chemex filter also brews a rich and robust cup of coffee, absorbing some of the coffee bean oils while allowing the acids to pass through. The filter is easy to cleanâ€”simply dump out the grounds into your compost, wash the filter under hot water and air dry. The filter is very durable and is designed to last about a year before it needs to be replaced.",
